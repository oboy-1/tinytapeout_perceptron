# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Perceptron"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Compute perceptron output from weights and inputs."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses 8-bit wires for 8 1-bit weights and 8 1-bit inputs.

      Calculates a dot product for them and outputs to a wire.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      idk fill in later

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - clock
    - reset
    - weight 1
    - weight 2
    - weight 3
    - weight 4
    - weight 5
    - weight 6
    - weight 7
    - weight 8
    
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - dot produce wire
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - input bit 1
    - input bit 2
    - input bit 3
    - input bit 4
    - input bit 5
    - input bit 6
